        <p align="left">It is not known why some planets have artefacts on them,
        it is rumored that they were left there by some long extinct ancient
        empire that ruled the galaxy millions of years ago. Artefacts are
        extremely rare and generally there are only a few of them scattered
        across the galaxy. If anyone finds them they will give a special bonus
        to the entire family of the lucky person who found them. Their bonuses
        have great variety, here are the artifacts from Beta 5:</p>

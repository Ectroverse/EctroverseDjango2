<p align="left">There are 2 different ways to earn research points. One of them
is to build <a href="buildings/research_center.htm">Research Centers</a>, or you
can also fund your research with energy, by writing the desired amount of energy
to spend in the box at the top and clicking on Fund. Note that for each 10
energy you put into research you only get one research point back. All that energy however
doesn't have to go into a specific branch of research, it can be divided as you
wish, the percents written above are identical to the ones you start out with,
if you wish to change them just type in a new number and press change (make sure
that after you type in the number you change the rest accordingly so that the
total is 100%). If you want you can spend all of your research in one branch,
that is up to you, here is a description of each branch of your
research.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p align="left"><b>Military: </b>Increases the attack and defense of your units,
making them stronger and harder to kill in combat. This is very useful if you
plan to be attacking a lot of people.</p>
<p align="left"><b>Construction:</b> Drastically reduces the construction costs
of both units and buildings, also shortens the time of construction.</p>
<p align="left"><b>Technology:</b> As you may have noticed some units in your
units menu are either unavailable or have <font color="#FF0000">Tech: +X% cost </font>written
under them. That's because your tech. research is not high enough. Again this
research is highly recommended if you are going to be attacking a lot.</p>
<p align="left"><b>Energy Production: </b>This is increases your energy
production. But it only increase the initial production and has no impact on
population's impact on upkeep (every 350 people your net upkeep decreases by 1
energy). Recommended for those that aren't as warlike as people above and wish
to create more and perhaps aid other empire members.</p>
<p align="left"><b>Portal efficiency: </b>This research increases the efficiency
of your portals. In order to have 100% protection on the planet you have to have
at least 1 portal in the system, and the farther you get away from that portal
the less protected your planets will be. But as your portal efficiency research
goes up your protection also goes up, and it doesn't decrease as much as it did
before when you go far away from the portal.</p>
<p align="left"><b>Culture: </b>Increases your total population, thus decreasing
your upkeep, again recommended for people who want to make a lot of energy. Also
increases the effectiveness of your psychics, this is alternative to what
Operations research does for agents.</p>

<p align="left"><b>Operations: </b>Works pretty much the same way as Military
Research, but affects the attack and defense of your agents rather than military
units, this is equivalent of what Culture research does to psychics.</p>

<p align="center"><font size="5">Research Calculators</font></p>

        <p align="left">This will calculate how many weeks you will need to
        obtain a certain level of research, given the networth and the number of
        Research centers&nbsp;
        </p>
        <form name="Research">

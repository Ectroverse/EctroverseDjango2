<p><font size="4">Energy</font></p>
<p>Energy is your basic resource which is needed to build every single units and
building, as well as to pay the upkeep for all of them. There are two
ways to produce energy, either by making a lot of fairly cheap <u><a href="buildings/solar_collector.htm">Solar
Collectors</a></u> or a lot more expensive <u><a href="buildings/fission_reactor.htm">Fission
Reactors</a></u>, which produce
almost 3 times more energy then the Solar Collectors. You should always
try to keep your energy net change in the positive side as if you run out of
energy you wouldn't be able to pay the upkeep and your fleet will slowly
disband. A way to minimize your upkeep is through Population. Energy cannot be
stored indefinitely and will decay, the more energy you have the faster it will
decay, the total decay will always amount to 0.5% of your total energy per week.</p>
<p><font size="4">Minerals</font></p>
<p>Minerals are used to build most buildings as well as fleet units unlike cash
however it is not needed to pay the upkeep for your army and buildings. Minerals
are produced by <u><a href="buildings/mineral_plant.htm">Mineral Plants</a></u>, which themselves require no minerals.</p>
<p><font size="4">Crystals </font></p>
<p>Crystals are used widely in unit production, especially when it comes to
building more Technologically advanced units. Crystals are produced by <u><a href="buildings/crystal_laboratory.htm">Crystal
laboratories</a></u>, which themselves require no crystals. As Crystals are a
carbon compound they decay, the rate is 2% of your total amount per week.</p>
<p><font size="4">Ectrolium</font></p>
        <p>Ectrolium is used in small quantities in production of almost all buildings
and units but still has to be taken seriously as it is no easy task to produce
this valuable element. Ectrolium is produced by the <u><a href="buildings/refinement_station.htm">Refinement stations</a></u>,
which themselves require no ectrolium.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

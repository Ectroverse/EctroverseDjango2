        <p align="center">(Note: Due to complexity and ever-changing nature of
        the battle formulas I decided to exclude them from the guide as they
        won't be much help anyway and you have to know just how big the enemy's
        fleet is and what bonuses he has to use them correctly.)&nbsp;</p>
        <p align="center"><font size="5"><b>Battle</b></font></p>
        <p align="left">In EctroVerse there are 4 main stages during a battle.
        The battle is played out according to a precise algorithm, so there is
        nothing random in the outcome of the battle, here is a brief description
        of each of the 4 stages:</p>
        <p align="left"><b><font size="4">Phase 1: The long range air battle</font></b></p>
        <p align="left">The first stage is a <a href="units/cruiser.htm">Cruiser</a>
        and <a href="units/phantom.htm">Phantom</a> versus Cruiser and Phantom stage. Here if you are attacking your cruisers will try
        to take out any defending Cruisers on the planet. If you are defending
        you defending Cruisers and Phantoms will try to take out the attacking Cruisers,
        Phantoms as
        well as the attacking <a href="units/carrier.htm">Carriers</a>. If you
        are attacking and the enemy defenses are overwhelming, then your forces
        will flee and no other stage of the battle would be fought. If you are
        defending, your forces can flee in the first stage but come back again
        in any of the next 3 stages.</p>
        <p align="left"><b><font size="4">Phase 2: Close range air battle</font></b></p>
        <p align="left">Here your Cruisers and Phantoms close in on the enemy defenses and
        your <a href="units/fighter.htm">Fighters</a> come to help as well. Here
        if you are attacking your primary goal is to take out as many enemy
        Cruisers, Fighters and Phantoms as you can, while if you are on the defending side
        you will try to take out the attacking Cruisers, Phantoms, Fighters, <a href="units/transport.htm">Transports</a>
        and <a href="units/bomber.htm">Bombers</a>. Carriers do not take any
        part in this stage of the battle as they have already let go of all the
        ships based on them. If you are attacking and the defending forces are
        overwhelming in this stage of combat you will retreat and the later
        stages would not be fought. If you are defending, your forces can flee
        here, but still fight the 3rd and 4th stages.</p>
        <p align="left"><font size="4"><b>Phase 3: Air vs. Ground</b></font></p>
        <p align="left">Here Bombers, Cruisers and Phantoms go after the defending <a href="units/Goliath.htm">Goliaths</a>
        and Phantoms,
        while those try to take out any Cruisers, Bombers and Phantoms, as well as prevent
        any Transports from landing on the planet. f you are attacking and the
        defending forces are overwhelming in this stage of combat you will
        retreat and the last stage would not be fought. If you are defending,
        your forces can flee here, but still fight the last stage.</p>
        <p align="left"><b><font size="4">Phase</font></b><font size="4"><b> 4: Ground vs. Ground</b></font></p>
        <p align="left">In this stage any of the attacking forces (<a href="units/soldier.htm">Soldiers</a>,
        <a href="units/droid.htm">Droids</a>, Goliaths, Phantoms)
        that made it to the ground would engage the whatever defending forces
        (Soldiers, Droids, Goliaths, Phantoms) there are. If any of the sides flee in this
        stage of&nbsp; the battle, it would be over and the opposing side would
        win. </p>
